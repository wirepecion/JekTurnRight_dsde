# Scraping

For Scraping part, we have two python script.
1. station_name_scraping.py
2. water_level_scraping.py

In  station_name_scraping.py, please ensure you've change dates before using:
```
# --- Configuration ---
# --- Please carefully check these configuration line ----
start_date_str = "01/01/2022"  # Start scraping date
end_date_str = "10/01/2022"
```

water_level_scraping.py can be used without any correction, but it's worth to notice that the used data is not up to date. (Though, it's enough for this project.)
